Welcome to my blog!

I will be exploring neuroscience to enhance my coding abilities. 
What better way to improve a skill that sucks than by using an interesting topic, right?

I am a data science student who's seeking a career focus on neuroscience and journalism.
In this blog, you'll see my projects, reflections, and exploration into the beautiful microscopic world of neuroscience.
